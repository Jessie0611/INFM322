    <h2>Week Five Discussion</h2>
    <h2><u>Question:</u></h2>
    <p>Week 5 : Ethics
        This Week, we read about ethics, why to study ethics in Informatics, ethics of web design, and Civic Learning.  According to the Association of American Colleges & Universities (2012), universities must prepare their students in Civic Learning.  According to AACU, "this is a turbulent and dynamic century, our nation’s diverse democracy and interdependent global community require a more informed, engaged, and socially responsible citizenry. Both educators and employers agree that personal and social responsibility should be core elements of a 21st century college education if our world is to thrive" To accomplish this proposal, the AACU identifies Five Dimensions in which college education can improve.  These are
        
       <br><br>Striving for excellence: developing a strong work ethic and consciously doing one’s very best in all aspects of college;
         
       <br><br>Cultivating personal and academic integrity: recognizing and acting on a sense of honor, ranging from honesty in relationships to principled engagement with a formal academic honors code;
         
       <br><br>Contributing to a larger community: recognizing and acting on one’s responsibility to the educational community and the wider society, locally, nationally, and globally;
         
       <br><br>Taking seriously the perspectives of others: recognizing and acting on the obligation to inform one’s own judgment; engaging diverse and competing perspectives as a resource for learning, citizenship, and work;
         
       <br><br>Developing competence in ethical and moral reasoning and action: developing ethical and moral reasoning in ways that incorporate the other four responsibilities; using such reasoning in learning and life.
        According to the week's reading, which of these dimensions do we cover in our course, and how do they impact your vision of web design?  Remember 2 references in APA format. The first posting must be around 150 to 200 words, and respond at least 2 other classmate

    <h2><u>My Discussion:</u></h2>
    <p>I feel as though our courses address all five of the dimensions outlined by the Association of American Colleges & Universities (AACU) in their proposal for Civic Learning. Having a good 'drive' or work ethic at work and in school is often a key factor in achieving professional success in any line of work. Also, by putting in a consistent effort to strive for excellence, people enhance their skills and knowledge. Web design involves decisions that can impact things like user privacy, accurate content, accessibility, and more. Web design has the power to influence society and shape online interactions. Designers should want to create content that is a positive addition to online society that also protects its user’s personal information. Considering other people’s perspectives helps us see potential biases or exclusionary practices that could stop certain users from using our website. Using other people's perspectives in your design creates a more positive UX all around. All five of these are somewhat tied together in a web of morals that should be considered when publishing a website to the community.</p>
