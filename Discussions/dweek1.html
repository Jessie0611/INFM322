    <h2>Week One Discussion</h2>
    <h2><u>Question:</u></h2>
   <p><b>Templates or Layout</b> <br>
    In this week's reading, we talk about layouts, templates, and a video on how to make a webpage in Dreamweaver. What are the main differences between designing a web page, using a layout or templates? Which one do you prefer? All of them used the standards and best practices of Web design. Do they accomplish the UX principles? Using the references of this week and others, you can find on the internet, write your reflection. Remember to use your references to support your position. Remember to answer two other peers.</p>
    <h2><u>My Discussion:</u></h2>
    <p>Templates in Dreamweaver are formatted to provide a consistent structure and design for multiple pages within a website. When you create a template, you define elements such as header, footer, navigation menu, and sidebars. These elements remain consistent across all the pages you make in the template. Any changes made to the template automatically reflect on all the pages linked to it, making it easier to maintain consistency throughout the website. This is a very convenient, I recall when I was first learning HTML and CSS I would have to correct and check new links on my header on every page to make sure they were all properly linked and updated. This was very time-consuming. The same goes for Layouts in Dreamweaver as well. Layouts include placeholders for header, footer, navigation, and content, but with a layout you create everything yourself. What layouts have that templates do not is the ability to edit some aspects of these sections. When choosing a layout over a template you are given the ability to modify all sections to suit your specific needs or unique designs for the webpage you are creating. Despite layouts being a little more time consuming to create, I personally prefer them because it gives you more creative freedom and the ability to create a more positive user experience. Templates will come in handy when I need to quickly create a cookie-cutter style webpage because all you need to input is the content.
