    <h2>Week Two Discussion</h2>
    <h2><u>Question:</u></h2>
    <p><b>What is web design?</b> <br>
        In this week assignment you read about crucial elements that websites must have, UX design, CSS, HTML, other important relations to web design.  How do you believed this will help you design extraordinaries websites?  What are your thought about which one are really needed and which are not? Using the references of this week and other you can find in the internet write you reflection.  Remember using your references to support your position</p>
        <h2><u>My Discussion:</u></h2>
    <p>In my opinion, UX design would be the most important part of web design. UX focuses on creating websites that are intuitive, easy to navigate, and provide a positive experience for users. It involves understanding user behaviors, conducting research, creating wireframes and prototypes, and optimizing the website's usability. If the users are having issues with a website they may refrain from using it, which means they may not complete their purchase or create an account - whatever the website may be used for. UX design is crucial for ensuring that users can accomplish their goals and enjoy using the website. 

        Knowing HTML and CSS is also a very important part of web design because it helps you understand what is creating the content on the page and how to manipulate them to look and function to whatever design you want. There are websites now, such as WordPress, that someone can design a web page with without actually knowing HTML and CSS. However,  I feel like these types of applications are limited to what they can accomplish. In my opinion, the best way to manipulate a web page design is using HTML and CSS. Knowing how to manipulate images and content to rotate, flip, or add opacity gives a website a more unique appeal to it that you cannot get from services like WordPress.
        
        One of the more challenging aspects of web development is making your page accessible to multiple types of devices. Knowing HTML and CSS will allow you to build highly responsive web pages that are more accessible to broader audiences. This shows website visitors that your company values inclusivity and can help improve the reach of your brand.
