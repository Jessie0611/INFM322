    <h2>Week Four Discussion</h2>
    <h2><u>Question:</u></h2>
    <p><b>Week 4</b> <br>
        In this week's readings, we talk about multimedia.  The following pages use a lot of multimedia.  Which one is, for you, the most outstanding?  What factor influenced your decision?  From what we learned in the course, which is the worst design? What factors are missing? <br>

    <h2><u>My Discussion:</u></h2>
    <p>A portfolio website is to demonstrate your abilities to possible employers and other users who may be looking to learn more themselves. The portfolio that grabbed my attention the most was Adham Dannaway's. He states on his landing page that he is a <b>"< coder >" </b> as well as a UI designer and it really shows. His landing page is very clean with appropriate white space so that it is not cluttered. It has a unique transition design with the side of the mouse over the photo that I thought was a very nice tough. His header also has a transition when you visit other pages that I thought was a nice touch as well and adds to the transition theme on the index page creating more consistency throughout the website. This website has an easy and user-friendly navigation that I did not see in some other examples. 
   <br><br>     Burno Simon had a funny portfolio, I liked how you could press <b>[H]</b> and the truck horn would honk, it was a very creative design but not very accessible and was a bit hard to drive to see the content. If you failed the driving course you could drag the webpage with the mouse to see the other content.
        
       <br> <br> The website that I found the least aesthetically pleasing was the Craftsman's. I did not like the marquee headings scrolling by the screen or the hover marquee effect. The blocks were large and bulky, with transitions as you scrolled, to many things were moving as you went down the page - animation overload. No clean white space available on the webpages.
