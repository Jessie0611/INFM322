<h2>Week Five Reflection</h2>
    <h2><u>5 Dimensions of Personal and Social Responsibility </u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Striving for excellence</li> <br>
        <li>Cultivating personal and academic integrity</li> <br>
        <li>Contributing to a larger community</li> <br> 
        <li>Take the perspective of others seriously</li> <br>
        <li>Developing competence in ethical and moral reasoning and action</li> <br>
    </ol>
    <div class="w5content">I feel as though our courses address all five of the dimensions outlined by the Association of American Colleges & Universities (AACU) in their proposal for Civic Learning. Having a good 'drive' or work ethic at work and in school is often a key factor in achieving professional success in any line of work. Also, by putting in a consistent effort to strive for excellence, people enhance their skills and knowledge. Web design involves decisions that can impact things like user privacy, accurate content, accessibility, and more. Web design has the power to influence society and shape online interactions. Designers should want to create content that is a positive addition to online society that also protects its user’s personal information. Considering other people’s perspectives helps us see potential biases or exclusionary practices that could stop certain users from using our website. Using other people's perspectives in your design creates a more positive UX all around. All five of these are somewhat tied together in a web of morals that should be considered when publishing a website to the community.</div>
