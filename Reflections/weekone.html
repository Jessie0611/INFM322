It provides a set of tags that define the elements on a page such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, forms, and more. HTML is responsible for the semantic structure and organization of the content, determining what each element represents and how it should be displayed. It serves as the backbone of a web page, defining its structure and content hierarchy.</p>
        <p>CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and appearance of a web page. It alows you to control the visual aspects of HTML elements. CSS separates the style and layout from the content, making it easier to make design changes without modifying the information displayed from HTML. CSS defines properties like colors, fonts, sizes, margins, positioning, and many other design aspects. CSS can be applied to multiple elements and can create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.</p>
