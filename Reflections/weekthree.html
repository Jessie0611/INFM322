    <h2><u>CSS vs Bootstrap</u></h2>
    <p>The choice between using CSS directly or utilizing a framework like Bootstrap depends on various factors and your specific project requirements.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><u>Bootstrap</u></h2>
    <p>Bootstrap can significantly speed up the development process, especially for rapid prototyping or when you need to build a website quickly. It provides a collection of pre-built components and responsive layouts that are ready to use, reducing the time required for styling and layout creation. Bootstrap is designed with a mobile-first approach, which means it offers responsive components and a grid system that automatically adjusts the layout based on the screen size. </p>
    <br>
    <h2><u>CSS</u></h2>
    <p>Using CSS directly gives you complete control over the design and styling of your website. You can create unique and highly customized designs tailored to your specific needs. While you can customize Bootstrap to some extent, it may not provide the same level of flexibility as writing your own CSS.  Becoming familiar with CSS will give you the necessary skills to create complex unique designs. Therefore, using CSS directly can be more efficient and provides greater control and customization options, but requires more time and expertise. Given that you have the time, always choose to use CSS first so your webpage will stand out against the rest! </p>
